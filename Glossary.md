## Trackback ##

On Topsy a trackback is a reference to a URL by an author.  A tweet with an URL is a Twitter Trackback. This is slightly more expansive usage of the term compared to its [original meaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback).  The Otter API provides the list of trackbacks for any URL that is in the Topsy index.
