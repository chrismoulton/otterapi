08/29/2012 - While we see the value in offering a free option, it's become untenable due to spam and abuse. Regrettably we'll be shutting down free open access in 30 days and requiring API keys to access the Otter API.

# Topsy's Otter API #

Otter API is a RESTful HTTP web service to Topsy. Topsy is a search engine that ranks links, photos and tweets by the number and quality of retweets they receive. The quality of retweets is determined by the influence of the Twitter users.

The Otter API provides access to topsy search results, url information and author information along with the intermediate data (like author influence) that is used in creation of search rankings. http://topsy.com/ has been created using the Otter API, and almost everything available on the site is accessible to developers.

The list of **[Resources](Resources.md)** describe the available resources and how to query them.
